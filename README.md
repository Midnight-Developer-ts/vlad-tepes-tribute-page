# 📜 Vlad Tepes Tribute Page

## 📖 Overview
This project is part of my FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. The objective of this Tribute Page was to build a responsive webpage using only HTML and CSS while honoring a historical figure. I chose Vlad Tepes (Vlad the Impaler) because his complex legacy, feared for his harsh punishments, yet remembered in Romania as a strong leader who defended his land.

The focus of this project was clean structure, semantic HTML, responsive design, and a simple layout that adapts smoothly across various screen sizes.
